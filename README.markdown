oggfilter
=========

What is it?
-----------
oggfilter is a commandline tool used to filter a set of ogg/vorbis files. It
checks certain properties defined via command line switches an returns all files
matching the filter criteria.

How can I use it?
-----------------

### Filter songs using playtime
Filter all ogg/files for file playing longer than 2 minutes and shorter than 300
seconds:

`find . -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -l 2:00 -L 300`

As you can see the playtime can be given in the form `minutes:seconds` or
`seconds`.

### Filter files with relative paths
If you are piping the content of a m3u playlist using relative paths to
oggfilter you can provide a base directory using the `-d` parameter.

`oggfilter -d /my/music -l 2:30 < relative.m3u`

The value passed using the `-d` parameter will be prepended to any filename not
starting with a slash '/'.

### Matching arbitrary vorbiscomments
If you want to filter for arbitrary vorbiscomments you can use regular
expressions.  If you want to filter for a given genre you can use:

`find . -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -x 'genre=black metal'`

Passing the `-E` parameter you can use extended regular expressions:

`find . -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -E -x 'genre=(death|black) metal'`

#### NOTES
 * oggfilter uses regular expressions always in a case insensitive way
 * at the moment only one regular expression can be passed to oggfilter

### Invert results
To select all ogg/vorbis files with a genre different than "Power Metal" you can
use:

`find . -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -v -x 'genre=power metal'`

### Match nominal bitrate
To find all ogg/vorbis files with a nominal bitrate between 110000 an 
120000 kbps use:

`find . -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -b 110000 -B 120000`

Why was it written?
-------------------
I haven't checked for existing code that's doing what I'm doing here. Instead I
thought this would be a tangible project to make my first practical experiences
in C. 

Portability issues?
-------------------
This program was written in ANSI/C so it should compile on every platform
supporting an ANSI/C compiler and libvorbis. But this was written on a FreeBSD
system an has not been tested on other platforms. 

The supplied Makefile is a BSD-style Makefile an uses the FreeBSD-make
infrastructure. This is not portable, but as oggfilter is pretty simple there
should be no problem to write a simple Makefile for other platforms.
