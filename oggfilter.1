.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
The
.Nm
utility reads sequentially a list of ogg/vorbis files from standard input  and
filters this list using various criteria defined via command line options. All
ogg/vorbis files matching these criteria are written to standard output.
.Pp
All specified criteria are combined using logical AND.
.Pp
These are the available command line options:
.
.Bl -tag
.It Fl l | Fl -min-length Ar period
Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a play time longer than the specified 
.Ar period .
.Ar period 
may be expressed as seconds or in minutes:seconds syntax. 
.
.It Fl L | Fl -max-length Ar period
Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a play time shorter than the specified 
.Ar period .
.Ar period 
may be expressed as seconds or in minutes:seconds syntax. 
.
.It Fl b | Fl -min-bitrate Ar bitrate
Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a nominal bitrate higher than
.Ar bitrate
kbps
.
.It Fl B | Fl -max-bitrate Ar bitrate
Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a nominal bitrate lower than
.Ar bitrate
kbps
.
.It Fl x | Fl -expression Ar regexp
Matches every ogg/vorbis file containing at least one vorbiscomment matching
the regular expression
.Ar regexp .
The regular expression matching is always case-insensitive.
.
.It Fl d | Fl -directory Ar directory
Prepends every line read from standard input with 
.Ar directory
if the first character of the line is not a slash.
.
.It Fl E | Fl -extended
Interpret 
.Ar regexp
as an extended regular expression rather than basic regular expressions.
See 
.Xr re_format 7
for a complete discussion of regular expression formats.
.
.It Fl v | Fl -invert
Invert the result set - return all ogg/vorbis files not matching the specified
criteria.
.
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Print the synopsis of 
.Nm
and exit. This overrides any other options.

.Sh EXAMPLES
To get a list of all your ogg/vorbis files tagged with genre 
.Dq Thrash Metal
use the following command line:
.Pp
.Dl find /my/music -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -x '^genre=thrash metal$'
.Pp
To filter a list of ogg/vorbis files for files not tagged as
.Dq Neo Folk
or
.Dq Power Metal
you may use:
.Pp
.Dl oggfilter -v -E -x '^genre=(neo folk|power metal)$' < playlist.m3u
.Pp
To get a list of all ogg/vorbis files with a maximum playtime of 5 minutes and
a minimum playtime of 3 minutes you may use:
.Pp
.Dl oggfilter -l 180 -L 5:00 < playlist.m3u
.Pp
To get a list of ogg/vorbis files encoded with a minimal nominal bitrate of
120 kbps use:
.Pp
.Dl oggfilter -b 120 < playlist.m3u
.Pp
If you are piping from a playlist containing relative paths you can tell
oggfilter to prepend a base path to the read ogg/vorbis files:
.Pp
.Dl oggfilter -d /my/music -x '^genre=.*metal$' < relative.m3u
.
