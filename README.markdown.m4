Portability issues
------------------
This program was written in ANSI/C so it should compile on every unix-like
platform supporting an ANSI/C compiler and libvorbis. But this was written on a
FreeBSD system an has not been tested on other platforms. 

The supplied Makefile is a BSD-style Makefile and uses the FreeBSD-make
infrastructure. This is not portable, but as oggfilter is pretty simple there
should be no problem to write a simple Makefile for other platforms.
