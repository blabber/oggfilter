DESCRIPTION
     The oggfilter utility reads sequentially a list of ogg/vorbis files from
     standard input  and filters this list using various criteria defined via
     command line options. All ogg/vorbis files matching these criteria are
     written to standard output.

     All specified criteria are combined using logical AND.

     These are the available command line options:

     -l | --min-length period
                 Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a play time longer than
                 the specified period.  period may be expressed as seconds or
                 in minutes:seconds syntax.

     -L | --max-length period
                 Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a play time shorter than
                 the specified period.  period may be expressed as seconds or
                 in minutes:seconds syntax.

     -b | --min-bitrate bitrate
                 Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a nominal bitrate higher
                 than bitrate kbps

     -B | --max-bitrate bitrate
                 Matches every ogg/vorbis file with a nominal bitrate lower
                 than bitrate kbps

     -x | --expression regexp
                 Matches every ogg/vorbis file containing at least one vorbis-
                 comment matching the extended regular expression regexp.  The
                 regular expression matching is always case-insensitive. See
                 re_format(7) for a complete discussion of the extended regu-
                 lar expression format. This option may be specified multiple
                 times.

     -X | --exclude-expression regexp
                 This is the inversion of the -x flag. It excludes any
                 ogg/vorbis files containing at least one vorbiscomment match-
                 ing the extended regular expression regexp.  This option may
                 be specified multiple times.

     -d | --directory directory
                 Prepends every line read from standard input with directory
                 if the first character of the line is not a slash.

     -v | --invert
                 Invert the result set - return all ogg/vorbis files not
                 matching the specified criteria.

     -P | --processes count
                 Instructs oggfilter to spawn count worker processes. This may
                 speed up the processing on multi processor machines. A good
                 choice is to set count equal to the amount of processor cores
                 available. By default oggfilter runs as a single process.

     -h | --help
                 Print the synopsis of oggfilter and exit. This overrides any
                 other options.

ENVIRONMENT
     oggfilter peruses the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables to determine
     the systems locale. This is mandatory for expression matching.

EXAMPLES
     To get a list of all your ogg/vorbis files tagged with genre ``Thrash
     Metal'' use the following command line:

           find /my/music -type f -name '*.ogg' | oggfilter -x '^genre=thrash
           metal$'

     To filter a list of ogg/vorbis files for files not tagged as ``Neo Folk''
     or ``Power Metal'' you may use:

           oggfilter -v -E -x '^genre=(neo folk|power metal)$' < playlist.m3u

     To get a list of all your ogg/vorbis files tagged with genre ``Thrash
     Metal'' and containing ``death'' in it's title use the following command
     line:

           oggfilter -x '^genre=thrash metal$' -x '^title=.*death.*' <
           playlist.m3u

     To get a list of all your ogg/vorbis files tagged with genre ``Thrash
     Metal'' and not containing ``death'' in it's title use the following com-
     mand line:

           oggfilter -x '^genre=thrash metal$' -X '^title=.*death.*' <
           playlist.m3u

     To get a list of all ogg/vorbis files with a maximum playtime of 5 min-
     utes and a minimum playtime of 3 minutes you may use:

           oggfilter -l 180 -L 5:00 < playlist.m3u

     To get a list of ogg/vorbis files encoded with a minimal nominal bitrate
     of 120 kbps use:

           oggfilter -b 120 < playlist.m3u

     If you are piping from a playlist containing relative paths you can tell
     oggfilter to prepend a base path to the read ogg/vorbis files:

           oggfilter -d /my/music -x '^genre=.*metal$' < relative.m3u

PORTABILITY
     oggfilter was written in ANSI/C so it should compile on every unix-like
     platform supporting an ANSI/C compiler and libvorbis. But this was writ-
     ten on a FreeBSD system and has not been tested on other platforms.

     The supplied Makefile is a BSD-style Makefile and uses the FreeBSD infra-
     structure. This is not portable, but as oggfilter is pretty simple there
     should be no problem to write a simple Makefile for other platforms.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages should be self-explanatory.

     The oggfilter utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     Expect some rough edges as this was my first take on a C program.

     oggfilter doesn't support wide or multibyte characters.
